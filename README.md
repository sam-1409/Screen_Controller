# Hands-free Smart Screen Controller
This project enables **hands-free control** of your Windows PC using **eye gaze** (for cursor movement) and **hand gestures** (for mouse clicks, drag, double-click, right-click, and virtual keyboard input) via your webcam. It combines [MediaPipe](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/) for face and hand tracking, [PyAutoGUI](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/) for system control, and a custom Tkinter-based virtual keyboard.

- **Blink to Toggle:** Enable/disable gaze cursor with a blink.
- **Pinch Gesture:**
